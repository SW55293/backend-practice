## Classes vs Functions

* Classes encourage you to think about the world as a collection of objects. Objects bundle behavior, data, and state together in a way that draws boundaries between instances of things (like chess pieces on a board).
Functions encourage you to think about the world as a series of transformations on data. 


* Functions take data as input, transform it, and return it as output. For example, a function might take the state of a chess board and a move as input, and return the new state of the board as output.
