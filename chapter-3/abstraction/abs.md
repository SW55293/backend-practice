ASSIGNMENT
A Human class with a constructor has already been created for you. We don't want the other game developers using our Human class to have to worry about how humans move, we'll abstract that data away from them by encapsulating the private __pos_x, __pos_y, and __speed variables.

Let's add the methods our users will actually call.

move_right(): Adds the human's speed to its x position
move_left(): Subtracts the human's speed from its x position
move_up(): Adds the human's speed to its y position
move_down(): Subtracts the human's speed from its y position
get_position(): Returns the x position and y position as a tuple

```python
import random

my_random_number = random.randrange(5)
```
