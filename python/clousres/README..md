### CLOSURE REVIEW
- Remember, the whole point of a closure is that it's stateful. It's a function that "remembers" the values from the enclosing scope even after the enclosing scope has finished executing.

- It's like you're saving the state of a function at a particular point in time, and then you can use and update that state later on.
